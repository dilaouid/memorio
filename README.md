## Welcome to Memorio! ðŸŽ®

Memorio is a dynamic memory game that challenges you to remember and replicate a path shown during a demo phase, using your keyboard's directional arrows. After watching a sequence of arrows light up on a grid, it's your turn to step up and trace the path from memory. Sounds simple? Think again! As you progress, the paths become more complex and the pressure mounts.

Ready to see how far your memory can take you? Dive into Memorio and set new high scores (if you can tho)

**Note:** Memorio is designed for keyboard interaction only. It's not designed for mobile or touch devices. Sorry mobile users! ðŸ˜…
